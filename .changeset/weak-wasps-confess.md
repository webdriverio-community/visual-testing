# Fix [495](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/495): module system issue when using with vite and storybook

This fix only allows `runner` to be the `local` one, if not, it will throw this error

```logs
pnpm test.local.desktop.storybook                                                                                                                                 â”€â•¯

# Fix [522](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/522): visual-reporter logs an error when there is no diff file

The output contained a `diffFolderPath` when no diff was present. This resulted in an error in the logs which is fixed with this PR

# Fix [524](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/524): Highlights are shown after re-render

When a diff is highlighted and the page was re-rendered it also showed the highlighted box again. This was very confusing and annoying

# ðŸ’… New Feature: Add ignore boxes on the canvas

If ignore boxes are used then the canvas will also show them

# ðŸ’… New Feature: Add hover effects on the diff and ignore boxes

When you now hover over a diff or ignore area you will now see that the box will be highlighted and has a text above it

**Diff area**

# ðŸ’… New Feature: Remove diff image before comparing

This solves the issue [425](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/425) of removing a diff image from the diff folder for success. We now remove the "previous" diff image before we execute the compare so we also have the latest, or we now have a diff image after a retry where the first run failed and produced an image and a new successful run.

# ðŸ’… Update dependencies

We've update all dependencies.
