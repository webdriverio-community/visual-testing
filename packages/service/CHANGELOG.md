## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- ef386b6: # üí• Breaking changes:

  - `resizeDimensions` on the element can now only be an object, it has been deprecated for a while

  # üíÖ New Features

  - Next to supporting Web snapshot testing this module now also supports üí• **Native App** üí• snapshot testing. The methods `saveElement|checkElement | saveScreen | checkScreen` and the matchers `toMatchElementSnapshot |  toMatchScreenSnapshot` are available for **Native Apps**

  > [!NOTE]
  > This module will automatically detect the context (web | webview | native_app) and will handle all complex logic for you

  The methods `saveFullPageScreen | checkFullPageScreen | saveTabbablePage|checkTabbablePage` will throw an error when they are used in the native context for native mobile apps and will look like this

  error Command failed with exit code 1.
  ```

  - `autoSaveBaseline` is true by default, so if no baseline images are present it will automatically create a new baseline
  - Mobile screenshots of the complete screen now automatically exclude all native OS elements like the notification bar, home bar, address bar, and so on, the settings `blockOutSideBar | blockOutStatusBar |blockOutToolBar` are now all defaulted to `true`
  -

  # üêõ Fixed bugs:

  - element screenshots could also get resized dimensions, which would cut out a bigger portion around the element. This was failing when the dimensions got out of the boundaries of the official screenshot. This has now been fixed with:
    - not going outside of the screenshot
    - log extra warnings
