  # Fix [522](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/522): visual-reporter logs an error when there is no diff file

  The output contained a `diffFolderPath` when no diff was present. This resulted in an error in the logs which is fixed with this PR

  # Fix [524](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/524): Highlights are shown after re-render

  When a diff is highlighted and the page was re-rendered it also showed the highlighted box again. This was very confusing and annoying

  # üíÖ New Feature: Add ignore boxes on the canvas

  If ignore boxes are used then the canvas will also show them

  # üíÖ New Feature: Add hover effects on the diff and ignore boxes

  When you now hover over a diff or ignore area you will now see that the box will be highlighted and has a text above it

  # üíÖ New Feature: Remove diff image before comparing

  This solves the issue [425](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/425) of removing a diff image from the diff folder for success. We now remove the "previous" diff image before we execute the compare so we also have the latest, or we now have a diff image after a retry where the first run failed and produced an image and a new successful run.

  # üíÖ Update dependencies

  We've update all dependencies.

### Patch Changes

  #### üöÄ New Features

  **Added Reporting output**
  You now have the option to export the compare results into a JSON report file. By enabling the module option `createJsonReportFiles: true`, each image that is compared will create a report stored in the `actual` folder, next to each `actual` image result.

  The output will look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "parent": "check methods",
    "test": "should fail comparing with a baseline",
    "tag": "examplePageFail",
    "instanceData": {
      "browser": {
        "name": "chrome-headless-shell",
        "version": "126.0.6478.183"
      },
      "platform": {
        "name": "mac",
        "version": "not-known"
      }
    },
    "commandName": "checkScreen",
    "boundingBoxes": {
      "diffBoundingBoxes": [
        {
          "left": 1088,
          "top": 717,
          "right": 1186,
          "bottom": 730
        }
        //....
      ],
      "ignoredBoxes": [
        {
          "left": 159,
          "top": 652,
          "right": 356,
          "bottom": 703
        }
        //...
      ]
    },
    "fileData": {
      "actualFilePath": "/Users/wswebcreation/Git/wdio/visual-testing/.tmp/actual/desktop_chrome-headless-shellexamplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768.png",
      "baselineFilePath": "/Users/wswebcreation/Git/wdio/visual-testing/localBaseline/desktop_chrome-headless-shellexamplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768.png",
      "diffFilePath": "/Users/wswebcreation/Git/wdio/visual-testing/.tmp/diff/desktop_chrome-headless-shell/examplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768png",
      "fileName": "examplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768.png",
      "size": {
        "actual": {
          "height": 768,
          "width": 1366
        },
        "baseline": {
          "height": 768,
          "width": 1366
        },
        "diff": {
          "height": 768,
          "width": 1366
        }
      }
    },
    "misMatchPercentage": "12.90",
    "rawMisMatchPercentage": 12.900729014153246
  }
  ```

  When all tests are executed, a new JSON file with the collection of the comparisons will be generated and can be found in the root of your actual folder. The data is grouped by:

  - `describe` for Jasmine/Mocha or `Feature` for CucumberJS
  - `it` for Jasmine/Mocha or `Scenario` for CucumberJS

  and then sorted by:

  - `commandName`, which are the compare method names used to compare the images
  - `instanceData`, browser first, then device, then platform

  it will look like this

  ```json
  [
    {
      "description": "check methods",
      "data": [
        {
          "test": "should fail comparing with a baseline",
          "data": [
            {
              "tag": "examplePageFail",
              "instanceData": {},
              "commandName": "checkScreen",
              "framework": "mocha",
              "boundingBoxes": {
                "diffBoundingBoxes": [],
                "ignoredBoxes": []
              },
              "fileData": {},
              "misMatchPercentage": "14.34",
              "rawMisMatchPercentage": 14.335403703025868
            },
            {
              "tag": "exampleElementFail",
              "instanceData": {},
              "commandName": "checkElement",
              "framework": "mocha",
              "boundingBoxes": {
                "diffBoundingBoxes": [],
                "ignoredBoxes": []
              },
              "fileData": {},
              "misMatchPercentage": "1.34",
              "rawMisMatchPercentage": 1.335403703025868
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

  The report data will give you the opportunity to build your own visual report without doing all the magic and data collection yourself.

### Major Changes

- a924dfc: # üöÄ New Feature

  Sometimes it can be hard to find an element in a mobile native app or desktop site, with an interactable Canvas, with the default [WebdriverIO selectors](https://webdriver.io/docs/selectors). In that case, it would be nice if you would be able to use something like OCR ([Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)) to interact with elements on your device/screen.

  The new `@wdio/ocr-service` service provides you with the option to interact with elements based on **visible text**. It will provide multiple commands to:

  - wait
  - search
  - and interact

  with an element, all based on text.

  The following commands will be added

  - `ocrGetText`
  - `ocrGetElementPositionByText`
  - `ocrWaitForTextDisplayed`
  - `ocrClickOnText`
  - `ocrSetValue`

    A CLI command will also be provided to pre-check text received from the image, this can be run by using the command `npx ocr-service`. For a demo check this video
