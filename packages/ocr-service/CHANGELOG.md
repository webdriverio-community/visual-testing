### Major Changes

- a924dfc: # üöÄ New Feature

  Sometimes it can be hard to find an element in a mobile native app or desktop site, with an interactable Canvas, with the default [WebdriverIO selectors](https://webdriver.io/docs/selectors). In that case, it would be nice if you would be able to use something like OCR ([Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)) to interact with elements on your device/screen.

  The new `@wdio/ocr-service` service provides you with the option to interact with elements based on **visible text**. It will provide multiple commands to:

  - wait
  - search
  - and interact

  with an element, all based on text.

  The following commands will be added

  - `ocrGetText`
  - `ocrGetElementPositionByText`
  - `ocrWaitForTextDisplayed`
  - `ocrClickOnText`
  - `ocrSetValue`

    A CLI command will also be provided to pre-check text received from the image, this can be run by using the command `npx ocr-service`. For a demo check this video
