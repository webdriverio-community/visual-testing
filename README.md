# WebdriverIO Visual Testing üîé [![tests](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/actions/workflows/tests.yml) [![Build Status](https://app.eu-central-1.saucelabs.com/buildstatus/wdio-image-comparison-service)](https://app.eu-central-1.saucelabs.com/u/wdio-image-comparison-service)

For documentation on visual testing with WebdriverIO, please refer to the [docs](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing). This project contains all relevant modules for running visual tests with WebdriverIO. Within the `./packages` directory you will find:

- `@wdio/visual-testing`: the WebdriverIO service for integrating visual testing
- `webdriver-image-comparison`: An image compare module that can be used for different NodeJS Test automation frameworks that support the WebDriver protocol

## Storybook Runner (BETA)

<details>
  <summary>Click to find out more documentation about the Storybook Runner BETA</summary>

> Storybook Runner is still in BETA, the docs will later move to the [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing) documentation pages.

This module now supports Storybook with a new Visual Runner. This runner automatically scans for a local/remote storybook instance and will create element screenshots of each component. This can be done by adding

```ts
export const config: Options.Testrunner = {
    // ...
    services: ['visual'],
    // ....
}
```

to your `services` and running `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook` through the command line.
It will use Chrome in headless mode as the default browser.

> [!NOTE]
> - Most of the Visual Testing options will also work for the Storybook Runner, see the [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing) documentation.
> - The Storybook Runner will overwrite all your capabilities and can only run on the browsers that it supports, see [`--browsers`](#browsers).
> - The Storybook Runner does not support an existing config that uses Multiremote capabilities and will throw an error.
> - The Storybook Runner only supports Desktop Web, not Mobile Web.

### Storybook Runner Service Options
Service options can be provided like this

```ts
export const config: Options.Testrunner = {
    // ...
    services: [
      [
        'visual',
        {
            // Some default options
            baselineFolder: join(process.cwd(), './__snapshots__/'),
            debug: true,
            // The storybook options, see cli options for the description
            storybook: {
                clip: false,
                clipSelector: ''#some-id,
                numShards: 4,
                // `skipStories` can be a string ('example-button--secondary'),
                // an array (['example-button--secondary', 'example-button--small'])
                // or a regex which needs to be provided as as string ("/.*button.*/gm")
                skipStories: ['example-button--secondary', 'example-button--small'],
                url: 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/storybook/',
                version: 6,
            },
        },
      ],
    ],
    // ....
}
```

### Storybook Runner CLI options

#### `--browsers`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** `chrome`, you can select from `chrome|firefox|edge|safari`
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --browsers=chrome,firefox,edge,safari`
- **NOTE:** Only available through the CLI

It will use the provided browsers to take component screenshots

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have the browsers you want to run on installed on your local machine

#### `--clip`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** `true`
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --clip=false`

When disabled it will create a viewport screenshot. When enabled it will create element screenshots based on the [`--clipSelector`](#clipselector) which will reduce the amount of whitespace around the component screenshot and reduce the screenshot size.

#### `--clipSelector`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** `#storybook-root > :first-child` for Storybook V7 and `#root > :first-child:not(script):not(style)` for Storybook V6, see also [`--version`](#version)
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --clipSelector="#some-id"`

This is the selector that will be used:
  - to select the element to take the screenshot of
  - for the element to wait to be visible before a screenshot is taken

#### `--devices`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** You can select from the [`deviceDescriptors.ts`](./packages/service/src/storybook/deviceDescriptors.ts)
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --devices="iPhone 14 Pro Max","Pixel 3 XL"`
- **NOTE:** Only available through the CLI

It will use the provided devices that match the [`deviceDescriptors.ts`](./packages/service/src/storybook/deviceDescriptors.ts) to take component screenshots

> [!NOTE]
> - If you miss a device config, then feel free to submit a [Feature request](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=--feature-request.md)
> - This will only work with Chrome:
>   - if you provide `--devices` then all Chrome instances will run in **Mobile Emulation** mode
>   - if you also provide other browser then Chrome, like `--devices --browsers=firefox,safari,edge` it will automatically add Chrome in Mobile emulation mode
> - The Storybook Runner will by default create element snapshots, if you want to see the complete Mobile Emulated screenshot then provide `--clip=false` through the command line
> - The file name will for example look like `__snapshots__/example/button/desktop_chrome/example-button--large-local-chrome-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-430x932-dpr-3.png`
> - **[SRC:](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/mobile-emulation#h.p_ID_167)** Testing a mobile website on a desktop using mobile emulation can be useful, but testers should be aware that there are many subtle differences such as:
>   - entirely different GPU, which may lead to big performance changes;
>   - mobile UI is not emulated (in particular, the hiding url bar affects page height);
>   - disambiguation popup (where you select one of a few touch targets) is not supported;
>   - many hardware APIs (for example, orientationchange event) are unavailable.

#### `--headless`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** `true`
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --headless=false`
- **NOTE:** Only available through the CLI

This will run the tests by default in headless mode (when the browser supports it) or can be disabled

#### `--numShards`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** `true`
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --numShards=10`

This will be the number of parallel instances that will be used to run the stories. This will be limited by the `maxInstances` in your `wdio.conf`-file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When running in `headless`-mode then do not increase the number to more than 20 to prevent flakiness due to resource restrictions

#### `--skipStories`

- **Type:** `string|regex`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** null
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --skipStories="/.*button.*/gm"`

 This can be:
  -  a string (`example-button--secondary,example-button--small`)
  - or a regex (`"/.*button.*/gm"`)

to skip certain stories. Use the `id` of the story that can be found in the URL of the story. For example, the `id` in this URL `http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/example-page--logged-out` is `example-page--logged-out`

#### `--url`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** `http://127.0.0.1:6006`
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --url="https://example.com"`

The URL where your Storybook instance is hosted.

#### `--version`

- **Type:** `number`
- **Mandatory:** No
- **Default:** 7
- **Example:** `npx wdio tests/configs/wdio.local.desktop.storybook.conf.ts --storybook --version=6`

 This is the version of Storybook, it defaults to `7`. This is needed to know if the V6 [`clipSelector`](#clipselector) needs to be used.

### Testing

Several tests need to be executed to be able to test the module. When adding a PR all tests must at least pass the local tests. Each PR is automatically tested against Sauce Labs, see [our GitHub Actions pipeline](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/actions/workflows/tests.yml). Before approving a PR the core contributors will test the PR against emulators/simulators / real devices.

#### Local Testing

First, a local baseline needs to be created. This can be done with:

```sh
// With the webdriver protocol
$ npm run test.local.init
```

This command will create a folder called `localBaseline` that will hold all the baseline images.

Then run:

```sh
// With the webdriver protocol
npm run test.local.desktop
```

This will run all tests on a local machine on Chrome.

#### Local Storybook Runner Testing (Beta)

First, a local baseline needs to be created. This can be done with:

```sh
npm run test.local.desktop.storybook
```

This will Storybook tests with Chrome in headless mode against a Demo Storybook repo located at https://govuk-react.github.io/govuk-react/.

To run the tests with more browsers you can run

```sh
npm run test.local.desktop.storybook -- --browsers=chrome,firefox,edge,safari
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have the browsers you want to run on installed on your local machine

#### CI testing with Sauce Labs (not needed for a PR)

The command below is used to test the build on GitHub Actions, it can only be used there and not for local development.

```
$ npm run test.saucelabs
```

It will test against a lot of configurations that can be found [here](./tests/configs/wdio.saucelabs.conf.js).
All PRs are automatically checked against Sauce Labs.
